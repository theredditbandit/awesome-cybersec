It is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity to becoming a “blue belt”, able to approach (simple) CTFs and wargames. The philosophy of pwn.college is “practice makes perfect”.
 
  
 *  [Web Application Exploits and Defenses](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/)This codelab is built around **Gruyere** /ɡruːˈjɛər/ - a small, cheesy web application that allows its users to publish snippets of text and store assorted files. "Unfortunately," Gruyere has multiple security bugs ranging from cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery, to information disclosure, denial of service, and remote code execution. The goal of this codelab is to guide you through discovering some of these bugs and learning ways to fix them both in Gruyere and in general.

- learning how various stacks function seems to be an important aspect of bug bounty hunting , so you need to learn at least one of MERN or LAMP or whatever.
You can learn the MERN Stack by building your own Yelp-like restaurant review site. MERN stands for MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js. Then in the second half of the course, you'll learn how to swap out your Node.js/Express back end in favor of Serverless Architecture. (3 hour YouTube course): [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-mern-stack-app-with-a-serverless-backend/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-mern-stack-app-with-a-serverless-backend/)

- [Pwncat](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat) is a post-exploitation platform ~~for Linux targets~~. It started out as a wrapper around basic bind and reverse shells and has grown from there. It streamlines common red team operations while staging code from your attacker machine, not the target.
